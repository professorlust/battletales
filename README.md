# Tales of Battle
Stories from the BattleMaster World


For close to 20 years, an online roleplaying game called [BattleMaster](http://battlemaster.org) has turned players from all over the world into mighty kings, scheming lords, fearless adventurers, pious priests and many, many more things.

The game is played in one persistent world, and over those 20 years, realms have risen and fallen, dynasties were created and destroyed and countless stories, tales and legends formed.

This book is a collection of some of those tales.


## Contributions

We are taking contributions to this book. There are two ways to contribute:

1. If you are familiar with Github and version control, and want to contribute several stories, fork this repository and send your contributions as pull requests. Please collect your stories in their own chapter(s) and don't edit other people's stories (pull requests with edits to other stories will be rejected).
2. Otherwise, you can add your own story by submitting it to Tom (tom@battlemaster.org).

Tom acts as editor for this book and retains the privilege of editing or deleting any content submitted before releasing a published copy.

* All files submitted should be in [Leanpub Falvoured Markdown or Markua](https://leanpub.com/help/manual#leanpub-auto-markdown-the-easiest-way-to-format-your-text-for-e-publishing). 
* Please use your name as the filename and add whatever you want (story name, etc.) after it. 
* Add a two-digit running number so the editor (me) knows in which order the files should appear. 
* Use .md or .txt as the file extension.
* So in summary, your filename could be "tomvogt_lasanarfamilystory_01.md"


## Publishing

The book will - in both draft and finished form - be published on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/). It will be free of charge (everything else would set up the issue of how much to pay to each contributor).

If it is somewhat successful, Tom will edit it into a pretty print copy. A printed book cannot be for free as printing is not. The printed version will be sold at a reasonable minimum price to cover printing costs.
