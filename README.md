# Tales of Battle
Stories from the BattleMaster World


For close to 20 years, an online roleplaying game called [BattleMaster](http://battlemaster.org) has turned players from all over the world into mighty kings, scheming lords, fearless adventurers, pious priests and many, many more things.

The game is played in one persistent world, and over those 20 years, realms have risen and fallen, dynasties were created and destroyed and countless stories, tales and legends formed.

This book is a collection of some of those tales.
