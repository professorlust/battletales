# Tales of Battle
Stories from the BattleMaster World


For close to 20 years, an online roleplaying game called [BattleMaster](http://battlemaster.org) has turned players from all over the world into mighty kings, scheming lords, fearless adventurers, pious priests and many, many more things.

The game is played in one persistent world, and over those 20 years, realms have risen and fallen, dynasties were created and destroyed and countless stories, tales and legends formed.

This book is a collection of some of those tales.


## Contributions

We are taking contributions to this book. You can add your own story by submitting it to Tom (tom@battlemaster.org) or by requesting access to this github repository and editing them directly. For this as well, contact Tom and you will be assigned your own part and chapters.

Tom acts as editor for this book and retains the privilege of editing or deleting any content submitted before releasing a published copy.


## Publishing

The book will - in both draft and finished form - be published on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/). It will be free of charge (everything else would set up the issue of how much to pay to each contributor).

If it is somewhat successful, Tom will edit it into a pretty print copy. A printed book cannot be for free as printing is not. The printed version will be sold at a reasonable minimum price to cover printing costs.
